          <p className={styles.bio}>Hello! I am a former educator turned <span className={styles.highlight}>Software Engineer</span>. I first became interested in computer science and web development after attending a conference related to the responsiveness of teachers to their students' academic needs. Being a teacher, I found that many of the applications available for teachers to track student data were very complex and hard to navigate. I made it a mission of mine to make this a thing of the past, and during this journey, became extremely passionate about software engineering. My goal now is to do for others what I was wanting to do for myself, which is to make their technological dreams a reality. Having the ability to take something from nothing but a dream and turn it into something tangible is what I live for nowadays. If you are on my page now, it is most likely because you have a dream that you are wanting to make a reality. Reach out today so that you and I can work together to make it happen!</p>
